      Link table for artist similarity relationships.
      
      **Data Handling:** When an artist appears in multiple tracks with slightly different 
      similar_artists arrays (same artists, different ordering), we take the first occurrence 
      ordered by track_id to ensure consistency and avoid duplicates.
