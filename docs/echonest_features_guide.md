# Echo Nest Time Series Features Guide

This guide provides comprehensive explanations of the Echo Nest audio analysis features used in the Lakh MIDI Dataset. The Echo Nest was a music intelligence platform acquired by Spotify in 2014, and its audio analysis technology continues to power Spotify's Audio Analysis API.

## Overview

The Echo Nest audio analysis engine contains a suite of machine listening processes that analyze audio files and output both low-level (such as beat timings) and high-level (such as danceability) musical information. Each temporal feature includes timing information and confidence scores, providing robust musical structure analysis.

## Bars Analysis

### Definition
**Bars** (also called measures) represent the primary metrical structure of music. A bar is a segment of time defined by a given number of beats.

### Technical Details
- **Start Time**: When each bar begins (in seconds)
- **Confidence**: Algorithm certainty in bar detection (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Musical Significance**: Bars define the fundamental rhythmic framework and are essential for understanding song structure and tempo

### Frequency Analysis
The time deltas between bars reveal:
- **Tempo stability**: Consistent bar lengths indicate steady tempo
- **Tempo changes**: Variations show ritardando, accelerando, or tempo shifts
- **Time signature**: Regular patterns reveal 4/4, 3/4, or other meters

## Beats Analysis

### Definition
**Beats** are the basic time units of music - the regular pulse that listeners tap their feet to. In the Echo Nest system, beats represent the perceived tactus or main pulse of the music.

### Technical Details
- **Start Time**: When each beat occurs (in seconds)
- **Confidence**: Reliability of beat detection (0.0 to 1.0)
- **BPM Calculation**: Beats per minute derived from inter-beat intervals (60 / time_delta)

### Musical Significance
- **Tempo Analysis**: Direct measurement of musical speed
- **Rhythmic Feel**: Beat timing variations reveal swing, shuffle, or straight feels
- **Synchronization**: Essential for music apps requiring beat-synchronized effects

Beats are typically multiples of tatums and subdivisions of bars, forming the rhythmic hierarchy.

## Sections Analysis

### Definition
**Sections** identify large-scale structural elements of songs such as verses, choruses, bridges, and instrumental solos. They are defined by significant changes in rhythm, timbre, or harmonic content.

### Technical Details
- **Start Time**: When each section begins (in seconds)  
- **Confidence**: Algorithm certainty in section boundaries (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Duration Analysis**: Time between sections reveals song structure patterns

### Musical Applications
- **Form Analysis**: Understanding ABABCB (verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus) structures
- **Content Recommendation**: Similar section patterns suggest musical similarity
- **Playlist Creation**: Section timing helps with seamless transitions

Sections represent the highest level of the Echo Nest's temporal hierarchy and are crucial for understanding musical form.

## Segments Analysis

### Definition
**Segments** are short-duration sound entities (typically under a second) that are relatively uniform in timbre and harmony. They represent the most granular level of Echo Nest's temporal analysis.

### Technical Details
- **Start Time**: When each segment begins (in seconds)
- **Confidence**: Reliability of segmentation (0.0 to 1.0) 
- **Loudness Analysis**: Peak loudness levels within each segment
- **Duration**: Typically 100-500ms, varying with musical complexity

### Advanced Features
Each segment includes detailed acoustic analysis:
- **Pitch Content**: 12-dimensional chroma vectors
- **Timbral Content**: 12-dimensional timbre vectors
- **Loudness Dynamics**: Peak and average loudness measurements

Segments are the foundation for detailed audio analysis and music information retrieval tasks.

## Pitch Chroma Analysis

### Definition
**Pitch chroma vectors** are 12-dimensional representations of harmonic content, corresponding to the 12 pitch classes of Western music: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B.

### Technical Implementation
- **Normalization**: Vectors normalized by strongest dimension (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Pitch Class Mapping**: Standard notation where 0=C, 1=C#/Db, 2=D, etc.
- **Harmonic Analysis**: Pure tones show one strong value, complex harmonies show multiple peaks

### Musical Applications
- **Chord Recognition**: C Major chord shows peaks at C, E, G (indices 0, 4, 7)
- **Key Detection**: Dominant pitch classes reveal tonal centers
- **Harmonic Similarity**: Similar chroma patterns indicate harmonic relationships

### Properties
Chroma features capture harmonic and melodic characteristics while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation. They provide octave-invariant representation of pitch content.

## Timbre Analysis

### Definition
**Timbre vectors** are 12-dimensional representations capturing the "tone color" or spectral characteristics of audio segments. These describe perceptual qualities like brightness, roughness, and spectral shape.

### Technical Implementation
- **Spectral Analysis**: Derived from spectro-temporal surface analysis
- **Independence**: Calculated independently of pitch and loudness
- **Basis Functions**: Linear combination of 12 basis functions weighted by coefficients

### Dimension Meanings
While the exact mapping is proprietary, research indicates:
1. **First dimension**: Average loudness/energy
2. **Second dimension**: Brightness/spectral centroid  
3. **Third dimension**: Spectral flatness
4. **Fourth dimension**: Attack characteristics
5. **Remaining dimensions**: Higher-order spectral properties

### Applications
- **Instrument Recognition**: Different instruments have characteristic timbre signatures
- **Sound Quality Analysis**: Timbre vectors capture perceptual audio qualities
- **Music Recommendation**: Similar timbre patterns suggest sonic similarity

## Tatums Analysis

### Definition
**Tatums** represent the smallest regular pulse that listeners intuitively infer from musical timing. Named after jazz pianist Art Tatum, tatums capture micro-rhythmic subdivisions.

### Technical Details
- **Start Time**: When each tatum occurs (in seconds)
- **Confidence**: Reliability of tatum detection (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Frequency Analysis**: Inter-tatum intervals reveal rhythmic complexity

### Musical Significance
- **Rhythmic Resolution**: Finest level of rhythmic analysis
- **Groove Analysis**: Tatum timing variations reveal swing, shuffle, or syncopation
- **Performance Style**: Timing deviations indicate human vs. mechanical performance

### Relationships
- Tatums are subdivisions of beats
- Multiple tatums typically occur per beat
- Essential for detailed rhythmic and groove analysis

## Confidence Scoring System

### Overview
All Echo Nest temporal features include confidence scores ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, indicating algorithm certainty in the analysis.

### Interpretation
- **High Confidence (0.8-1.0)**: Strong, clear musical features
- **Medium Confidence (0.4-0.8)**: Moderate certainty, some ambiguity
- **Low Confidence (0.0-0.4)**: Uncertain detection, possibly due to noise or complexity

### Applications
- **Quality Control**: Filter unreliable detections
- **Weighted Analysis**: Emphasize high-confidence features
- **Error Detection**: Identify problematic audio regions
